# Mtr-deplotï¼šChart to Table Model based on a new data fusion method - Perturbation Fusion tree

**Mtr-deplot** is a three-generation model that improves performance by changing the table post-processing method.

We mainly generate different answers by perturbing the decoding parameters of the delpot model, then structure the table in the answer into a tree, and then synthesize the most perfect answer tree as output in a voting weighted form
